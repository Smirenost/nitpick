A code style guide for Python projects.

A central place to keep all linting and doc generation tools, so you don't need to install these dependencies in every project you create.

Setup
-----

To install Nitpick, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install nitpick

To nitpick your project:

- Add ``nitpick`` to your ``Pipfile`` or ``requirements.txt``;
- Configure your ``setup.cfg`` file;
- Tools like ``flake8`` and `isort`` will be available on the CLI.
